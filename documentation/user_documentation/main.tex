\section{\LARGE{APPLICATION}}
\subsection{\Large{Application}}
As the bussiness is shifting towards the e-commerece websites such as amazon,flipkart etc.So every such website offer different discounts from time to time to attract customers.It is time consuming for the customer to check each such website to get the best deal.So in our project we make a common platform where the user only need to enter the product name and our website compares the price of that product on different websites(particularly amazon, flipkart, paytm mall and snapdeal) and suggest the best deal to the user.   ggo
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{\large$\bullet$}
    \item Price Comparator has the best utility for the shoppers.They can view the best deals and offers for the particular product they are looking for.
    \item Price comparator site also gives ecommerce websites a good opportunity to boost their sales and  attract new customers.
\item  Shoppers can compare prices, and service from multiple online websites on a single page and choose the site that offers the best overall value.
\item This will make easy shopping with best deals as well as ecommerce merchants to know well about their competitors.
\end{itemize}
